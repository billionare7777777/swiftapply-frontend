## API Endpoints

### Health Check
- `GET /api/health` - Check if the backend is running

### Job Management

- `POST /api/jobs/search` - Search jobs with filters
- `POST /api/jobs/scrape` - Force new job scrape

### Resume Generation
- `POST /api/resume/generate` - Generate resume (template-based for MVP)

### Dashboard

## How It Works

### Job Scraping
1. **Target**: Scrapes jobs from https://my.greenhouse.io/jobs
2. **Method**: Uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and extract job information
3. **Data**: Captures job title, company, location, salary, URL, and posted date
4. **Respectful**: Includes proper User-Agent headers and reasonable request intervals

### Job Search
- Real-time filtering by job title, company, and location
- Automatic refresh with configurable intervals
- Clean, card-based job display

### Resume Generation
- Simple form-based resume creation
- Template-based generation for MVP
- Download and copy functionality

### Application Tracking
- Manual application entry and status tracking
- Status updates (pending, submitted, interviewing, rejected, accepted)
- Notes and application history
